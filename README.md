About
=====

This is the repository containing my dotfiles, most notably my vim
configuration.

Installation
============

To install the dotfiles, run `./install.sh` in the root of the repository.
The install script assumes you're not running it from another directory, it
won't work if you do so!

The install script makes symlinks from the repository to your home directory,
the purpose being to ease updating. That means you musn't remove the
repository, or you'll have dangling symlinks! If you don't want that behaviour,
copy the files yourself from the repository.
